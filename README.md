Fresh-eats is a simple and responsive food ordering app built using React. It allows users to browse a list of food items. The app uses useState to manage local state for things like the shopping cart, user input, and food item selection. It also uses useEffect to fetch data from a backend or API when the component mounts, such as loading restaurant data or menu items dynamically.
